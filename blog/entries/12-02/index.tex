\title{Why Introverted Roommates Stink}
\author{Jerich Lee}

\begin{document}

\maketitle
I thought I would make this blog post because I wanted to vent a little steam. Just a lil. For some background, I've been living 
with two roommates who are awesome people. They are great humans, and they work extremely hard. The only problem is that they don't talk to me!
\vspace{.5cm} 

As a social butterfly myself, I can't go too long without some social actionâ€”it's just a result of me growing up in a big family. 
These guys must have had no one to talk to growing up, because I feel so so so awkward just even being around them. I don't I can take it any longer than one more semester.
\vspace{.5cm} 

Here's a list of why it sucks to live with these introverts:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item They don't talk unless spoken to
    \item They don't reciprocate when they are spoken to
    \item Because of the above, they make me feel like I am being constantly annoying
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Verdict:}
Just don't engage in too much convo, let the convo die if it has to. You can still be polite and respectful of course, as you are. That is all.
