        <p><h1>Winter Break Goals 2024</h1>
<h3>Jerich Lee</h3>
<h4>December 22, 2024</h4>
I'm sitting in my usual spot in the sunroom at my house in California, and I'm planning my goals for this winter break. I'm here for a month,
so I want to get some good rest but also work through some learning while I'm here.</p>
<p>I'm taking three math classes next semester: 
<ol>
<li>abstract algebra</li><li>complex analysis</li><li>topology</li>
</ol>
I want to get through Chapter 4 of each book, which corresponds to about 100 pages in each book, which is honestly a decent amount. I want to start building my pages for each of them on this site.</p>

<p>I also want to write a bit of how absurd instant messaging is. There's a couple things on my mind. Isn't such a weird feeling to know that the person on the other end <em>has</em> read your message within seconds of pressing send? 
Like, e.g., at least back then when you had to send physical mail, (or even gmail), you were conscious that there was a good chance that there existed some time delay in which the person on the other end would read your message. There
is some level of comfort that occurs when knowing that your message hasn't been opened yet; it gives one time to think about the message, although it can't be unsent. It allows one to empathize with the other person, thinking about how they would think/respond to that message. My whole point is that there even exists some sort of time buffer.</p>
<p>The problem I am facing is that my messages get read instantly. That almost forces me to think about my messages a bit harder; to ensure that they are more careful. To do all of the thinking that I mentioned above before I even press send. It just doesn't feel right.</p>
<p>But this doesn't mean that my messages get an instant response. It is a funny thing when you give yourself a time buffer in response to other people; perhaps for the girl you are interested in, you give it 10 minutes before your respond back. Maybe for your mother, you give it a couple hours. Maybe to your boss, you make it instant. I don't know. 
Doesn't the whole fact that <em>everyone</em> does this now just seem a little strange? Why doesn't everyone just respond instantly? Why not set up an automated messaging system? How does this time buffer change over time, over how the relationship changes, over how frequent you see each other in person? Or what about how that buffer change as a consequence of your lack to meet the other person's expected time buffer?</p>
<p>I know it's not right to overanalyze things like these, but I just thought I would point it out. Maybe I'll start a series just about modern day absurdities that arise from having the power of the internet at our fingertips.</p>
<p>I decided that the solution to my quagmire is that I will respond to everyone who messages me by the end of the day. It isn't fair of me to wait for a couple days to respond, especially knowing that the person on the other end knows that I have read their message (almost like a reverse situation from what I described above?). This way, I know that I am certain that the other person is certain of my expected delivery time. That is another data point in my set of axioms in which the curve of the Life of Jerich is interpolated through.</p>
