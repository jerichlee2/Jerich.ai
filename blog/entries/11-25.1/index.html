Dear Diary, 
<br> 
I am understanding myself a bit better. I am learning about my life every single day. I wanted to reiterate on what I was talking about—and thinking—regarding my life. 

I didn't grow up with the greatest childhood; but I also didn't grow up with the worst childhood. I grew up in a semi-dysfunctional family. My father and mother did their best to be good parents but I don't think any pair of parents attempting to raise five children will ever do a good job to be honest—that is unless you are a very religious family (kira). 

Perhaps I should read more diaries; as well as more poems. To learn about the human heart is a difficult one; yet it is immensely rewarding. 

I think meditation at night will help me fight the noise in my mind. I will continue to be consistent with it throughout the semester.

My goal is to attend graduate school in mathematics. I am attracted by the beauty of mathematics. It is pure to me. 

Consistent lifting and cardio has proven to be really beneficial to me. As well as daily literature reading. I hope to continue this throughout my life. I am thinking about adding a metric for meditation in Aeren. 

I am excited to build aerendeck, but I do have my concerns. I am worried that I will use it for cubing...my vice. The way to combat this is to use an e-paper display—used only for writing. The problem is the refresh rate is not good. 

I need to message my family and friends. But I was reflecting today—thinking about that one TSwift song—<em>both of us</em>. <em>I wish I was strong, enough, to lift—not one; but both of us</em>. I need time to regain my strength. I am almost there. But I need my own time. 

This semester I will focus on MATH 447, other school work, SEM, and finally, family and friends. I will do my very best. Because <em>beauty will save the world</em>. 

<br> 
Jerich
