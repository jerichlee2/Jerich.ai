<div class='problem'><strong>Problem.</strong><br> [18.7]
  Prove (xe^{x} =2) for some (x) in ((0,1)).  
</div>
<div class='solution'><strong>Solution.</strong> 
  <div class='proof'><strong>Proof.</strong> 
    Our goal is to show that (f=x) and (g=e^{x}) are both continuous, then invoke Theorem 17.4 part iii): Let (f) and (g) be real-valued functions that are continuous at (x_0) in (\mathbb{\MakeUppercase{r}} ). Then: 
    $$\begin{align}

     fg \text{ is continuous at } x_0 
    
\end{align}$$
    To show that (f=x) is continuous, we can show the following:
    $$\begin{align}

     \left\vert x_n -x\right\vert <\varepsilon
    
\end{align}$$
    Choosing (\delta =\epsilon ), we get:
    $$\begin{align}

     \left\vert x_{n} -x \right\vert <\delta \implies \left\vert f(x_n)-f(x) \right\vert <\epsilon
    
\end{align}$$ 
    We wish to prove that the function ( f(x) = e^x ) is continuous.
  
    Let ( \epsilon > 0 ). We need to show that for every ( \epsilon > 0 ), there exists ( \delta > 0 ) such that if ( |x - x_0| < \delta ), then ( |e^x - e^{x_0}| < \epsilon ).
    
    Starting with the expression:
    $$\begin{align}

    |e^x - e^{x_0}| &= e^{x_0} |e^{x - x_0} - 1|
    
\end{align}$$
    Now, we use the elementary inequality:
    $$\begin{align}

    e^y &\geq 1 + y
    
\end{align}$$
    For ( y = -y ), we get:
    $$\begin{align}

    e^{-y} &\geq 1 - y
    
\end{align}$$
    which implies:
    $$\begin{align}

    \frac{1}{1 - y} &\geq e^y \quad \text{for } y < 1
    
\end{align}$$
    Hence:
    $$\begin{align}

    |e^y - 1| &\leq \max \left\{ |y|, \left| \frac{y}{1 - y} \right| \right\} \quad \text{for } y < 1
    
\end{align}$$
    
    Thus, taking ( y = x - x_0 ), we have:
    $$\begin{align}

    |e^y - 1| &\leq \max \left\{ |y|, \left| \frac{y}{1 - y} \right| \right\}
    
\end{align}$$
    
    Now, choose ( \delta ) small enough such that ( |y| = |x - x_0| < \delta ) satisfies:
    $$\begin{align}

    \max \left\{ |y|, \left| \frac{y}{1 - y} \right| \right\} &< e^{-x_0} \epsilon
    
\end{align}$$
    and ( |y| < 1 ).
    
    Therefore, we can conclude that ( e^x ) is continuous at ( x_0 ).
    \vspace{.5cm} 
    Invoking Theorem 17.4 iii), we show that (xe^{x}) is a continuous function. To show that there exists (x) such that (h=xe^{x}=2), we can show that pick two points in ((0,1)) : (x_1=0.01), and (x_2=0.99), and substitute these into (h), getting (h(x_1)=0.01) and (f(x_2)=2.66). (h(x_1)<2<h(x_2)), and because (h) is continuous on ((0,1)), we can invoke the IVT, which proves that there exists (x) such that (xe^{x}=2).

<div class='problem'><strong>Problem.</strong><br> [21.2]
    Consider (f:S\to S^{*}) where (S,d) and (S^{*}, d^{*}) are metric spaces. Show that (f) is continuous at (s_{0}\in S ) if and only if for every open set (U) in (S^{*} ) containing (f(s_{0} )), there is an open set (V) in (S) containing (s_{0}) such that (f(V) \subseteq U).
</div>
<div class='solution'><strong>Solution.</strong> 
<div class='proof'><strong>Proof.</strong> 
  (\implies:) The goal is to show that every point in (V) has a neighborhood, i.e., is open. Because (U) is open, we know that there exists (r=\varepsilon) for each point (y\in U). Because (f) is continuous, we also know that there is a corresponding (\delta>0) such that (s\in B_{\delta}(x)=V), so this implies that there exists an open ball (V) around each point (s) in (S). Because (d(s,s_0)<\delta \implies d(f(s),f(s))<\varepsilon), and (\delta = V), (\varepsilon \subseteq U), as there may be other points not in (\delta) that map into (U), this implies (f(V)\subseteq U). 
  \vspace{.5cm}

  (\impliedby:) We know that (V) is open for every (U) in (S^{*}). Choose (\varepsilon \in U  s.t.  \varepsilon >0). Then choose (\delta \in V  s.t.  \delta >0). By implication, we know that (\delta) is open. Then, we can state that (d(s, s_0)<\delta \implies d(f(s),f(s_0))<\varepsilon), which is the definition of continuity at a point.

    Let ((S,d)) be a metric space and choose (s_{0} \in S). Show (f(s)=d(s,s_{0})) defines a uniformly continuous real-valued function (f) on (S).
</div>
<div class='solution'><strong>Solution.</strong> 
<div class='proof'><strong>Proof.</strong> 
  We to show the definition of continuity:
  $$\begin{align}

    \forall \epsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0 \text{ such that } d_Y(f(p), f(q)) &< \epsilon \\
    \forall p, q \in X \text{ for which } d_X(p, q) &< \delta. 
    
\end{align}$$
    We know that:
    $$\begin{align}

      f(s_0) = d(s_0, s_0) = 0 \\[10pt] 
      f(p)= d(p, s_0) \\[10pt] 
      f(q)= d(q, s_0) \\[10pt] 
      d_Y(f(p),f(q))\leq d(f(p)) + d(f(q))\\[10pt] 
    
\end{align}$$
We want to show using the triangle inequality:
$$\begin{align}
 
      d(f(p),f(q))\leq d(f(p),f(s_0))+d(f(q),f(s_0))< \varepsilon

\end{align}$$
From Eqn 13, 14, and 15, we can say: 
$$\begin{align}

  d(f(p),f(q))\leq d(p,s_0)+d(q,s_0).

\end{align}$$
Choosing (p,q) such that (d(p,s_0)<\frac{\varepsilon}{2}) and (d(q,s_0)<\varepsilon) , we can pick (\delta =\varepsilon) and use Eqn 14 and 15 to show:
$$\begin{align}

  d(f(p),f(q))\leq d(f(p))+d(f(q))\\[10pt] 
  \leq d(p,s_0)+d(q,s_0)<\varepsilon

\end{align}$$

    Consider (f:S\to \mathbb{\MakeUppercase{r}} ) where ((S,d)) is a metric space. Show the following are equivalent:
    <ol>
<li>(f) is continuous;</li>
<li>(f^{-1}((a,b)) ) is open in (S) for all (a<b);</li>
<li>(f^{-1}((a,b))) is open in (S) for all rational (a<b).</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class='solution'><strong>Solution.</strong> 
  <div class='proof'><strong>Proof.</strong>   
    (1\implies 2): We know that any open interval ((a,b)) in (R^{1}) is complete, i.e., every subsequence converges to a limit point contained in (\mathbb{\MakeUppercase{r}}). Therefore, ((a,b)) is an open set in (\mathbb{\MakeUppercase{r}}). We know from Problem 2 that if (f) is continuous, then every open set in the range corresponds to an open set in the domain. ((a,b)) is open, so (f^{-1}(a,b)) is also open.    
    <div class='qed'>∎</div></div><br>
<div class='proof'><strong>Proof.</strong>   
(1\implies 3): By (1\implies 2), we know that if (a,b\in \mathbb{\MakeUppercase{q}} ), then ((a,b)) is open by the denseness of the rationals, i.e., between every real there exists a rational.  
<div class='qed'>∎</div></div><br>
<div class='proof'><strong>Proof.</strong>   
(3\implies 1): We achieve this by taking the converse of (1\implies 3), which exists by the bijection of (1\implies 2).

    g(x)=\frac{1}{1+(x-x_0)^{2}}

(g(x)) is bounded, as (0<g(x)<1) for all (x). (g(x)) has no maximal element, as (x_0) is not a member of (E).</li>

<div class='problem'><strong>Problem.</strong><br> [21.10(d)]
    Explain why there are no continuous functions mapping ([0,1]) onto ((0,1)) or (\mathbb{\MakeUppercase{r}}).
</div>
<div class='solution'><strong>Solution.</strong> 
  We know that ([0,1]) is compact according to the according to the Heine-Borel Theorem, as it is closed and bounded. According to Theorem 21.4, if (E) is compact, then (f(E)) is compact. ((0,1)) and (\mathbb{\MakeUppercase{r}}) are not compact, so this contradicts Theorem 21.4..
</div>
<div class='problem'><strong>Problem.</strong><br> 
  Is it true that any bounded continuous function on (\mathbb{\MakeUppercase{r}}) is uniformly continuous? 
</div>
<div class='solution'><strong>Solution.</strong> 
  No. Choose (f=\frac{1}{x-x_0}) with (x\in (0,x_0)). Uniform continuity states that (\forall \varepsilon, \exists \delta  s.t.  d(p,q)<\delta \implies d(f(p),f(q))) for all (p, q). Choose an arbitrary (\varepsilon). Then, there exists a corresponding (\delta) such that (d(x,x_0)<\delta\implies d(f(x),f(x_0))<\varepsilon). But as we take the same (\delta) about (x) closer and closer to (x_0), (d(f(x),f(x_n))) will grow larger and larger, eventually exceeding our chosen (\varepsilon). Therefore, there exists no constant (\delta) that satisfies our chosen (\varepsilon). Therefore, our bounded, continuous function (f) is not uniformly continuous.
