\title{Finals Plan}
\author{Jerich Lee}

\begin{document}

\maketitle
I wanted to make a plan for my finals schedule, which is more specific than my old blog post. (which i have yet to fio how to implement in my python converter...)
\subsection{Physics}
For physics, I am going to:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item go through every problem one by one, ensuring I understand the material and where the equations come from. I won't worry about having a 100 percent understanding this first pass, and I'll explain why.
    \item do each problem without looking at the answer and coding each one
    \item do a \emph{new} practice final for each exam
\end{enumerate}
If I get an 80 percent or above on both, I will stop studying. Else, I will repeat steps 1 and 2, except 2 will be done on the exam taken in step 3.
\subsection{Math}
For math:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Put down Rudin (sorry :'â€‘( ) and use Ross
    \item go through all practice final problems given by oikhberg
    \item go through all slides and understand (not 100 percent) each statement proved
    \item reprove each major theorem and lemma
    \item go through all homework assignments and redo each problem
    \item go through all practice exam problems and redo each problem
    \item go through all exams and redo each problem
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{remarks}
\begin{enumerate}
\item My priority this week is physics 213/214.
\item I will catch office hours for math on wed for last min hw 10 help
\item I will complete CEE and the TAM project this weekend.
\item ME final is TBD. 
\item math and tam final is two weeks from now. tam should not be too bad but might be a pain in the ass. math should be a focused, deliberate, disciplined grind. I am not shooting for a perfect grade, but rather a deep understanding of the material wrt lifelong learning.
\item for math, no lean, no latex. just pure pen and paper. this is honestly the best and most effective way to learn imo. everything is embellishments. nothing beats old school grinding it out and chicken scratch.
\end{enumerate}  
\end{document}
